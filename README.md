# Inside-Environment-system
This source code is for my first semester project at Aalborg University. It features a Indoor Climate Sensor System.
The system uses different sensors to capture Indoor Climate variables such as CO2, temperature and humidity. These are all variables which
can affect you and your colleagues well being in a working environment. This project was created by me and my group to capture some of this data
to send it to af phone via GSM for later processing. This system could be expanded with actuators to react on CO2, temperature and humidity levels.

The system uses the following sensor.
- Analog CO2 sensor
- DHT11 Temp and humidity sensor
- Homemade microfound amplifier circuit to capture sound levels.
- Standard RTC module which can be easily found on ebay
